**Total time spent so far: 8hrs**

## First week of June: Research
> Watched hell lotta youtube videos to get a basic idea and all of what i wanted to make and how i wanted my keyboard to look like  
> I decided to go with a TKL Mechanical Keyboard layout with some customisations  

| Layout                            |
| --------------------------------- |

> The keyboard is gonna have `11 macro keys (basically integrated macropad)`, a `Rotary Encoder Switch E11`, and a `0.91inch OLED Display 128x32` and is gonna use `STM32F411CEU6 Black Pill Board` as its mcu.  

> it was REALLY painful to find out symbol and footprint of `STM32F411CEU6 Black Pill Board`  

**Time spent: 3hrs**


## 08th June: Got started
| Basic Schematic                      |

> Got done with keyboard matrix and wiring   

> Found out STM32F411CEU6 Black Pill Board on EasyEDA, converted .json files into symbol and footprint of it  
> Decided to make the keyboard Low profile since i dont really like the chunky ones(yet to finalise the switches and keycaps)  

**Time Spent: 5hrs**
